# Ecommerce Website for Django Beginners: 
If you are just started to learn django and have spent 1 or 2 weeks in learning then this project is for you! By building this eCommerce website you will get a practical view of the architecture and the flow of the code.
I have used HTML templates, CSS and JS Files + Basic Bootstrap code for making a little bit interactive.
You can clone this project and after running (py manage.py runserver) in your terminal and also after creating a superuser for administration (py manage.py createsuperuser), you can go to (http://localhost:8000/admin/) and do your own product listing.
